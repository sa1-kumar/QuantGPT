# QuantGPT Documentation

Quick reference for building and learning.

## Start Here

1. **[Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** — Your main roadmap. Check phase status, branching strategy, and what to build next.
2. **[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — System diagrams and component descriptions. Update as you implement.
3. **[Learning Log](LEARNING_LOG.md)** — Log what you learn after each phase.
4. **[Interview Prep](INTERVIEW_PREP.md)** — Project pitch, common questions, tech one-liners. Review before interviews.

## Workflow

1. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the current phase
2. Create the feature branch from `develop`
3. Build → update `ARCHITECTURE.md` if needed → log in `LEARNING_LOG.md`
4. Merge to `develop`, move to next phase
